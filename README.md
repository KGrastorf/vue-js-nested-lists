# Vue.js & Nested Lists - FIXED

This is the fixed version of the project found on the 'master' branch.

For an explanation of this project, please visit my [Vue.js blog](http://patrickwho.me/vue-js-nested-list-iteration-and-async-data-loading).

## Branches

master - the broken version demonstrating the problem
fixed - the fixed version

Examine the 'master' branch and see if you can't figure out a way to fix the problem before switching to 'fixed' to see my solution.

This repo uses the Vue CLI webpack-simple template

``` bash
